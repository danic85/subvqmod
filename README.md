subvqmod
========

Create VQMod XML files from a Subversion patch file.

This script is written in PHP and, when provided with a valid Subversion patch file, parses the contents and translates it into a VQMod XML change file.

The script finds a unique 'find' anchor point for each change using the patch file, and if necessary, the original code.
